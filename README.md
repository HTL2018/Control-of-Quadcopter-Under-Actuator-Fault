# Overview <br />

The program is designed for my course project in fault diagnosis and prognosis <br />

#Software requirement: <br />

MATLAB <br />

#To run the code: <br />

run "QuadSimulation.m"<br />

#Design Idea: <br />

- **Dynamic equations** <br />
    The dynamic equations are derived using Euler-Langrangian approach.
- **Parameter estimation** <br />
    Use normalized gradient descent to learn the parameters mapping from motor input to output lift/drag force
